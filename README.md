# Deep_learning_for_android_malware_detection
Effectiveness of additional training of an ANN based model in detectining android malware

The objectives for this project are; 
1. To analyse android apk files. 
2. Extract features significant for malware detection. 
3. Build ANN based model , train and test it using extracted features. 
4. Use GAN to generate adversarial malware samples whose features are used for additional training of the model. 
5. Test the final model to evaulate the effectiveness of additional training with adversarial samples.

Analysis of apk files:
*Analysis is automated by using CucooDroid which is capable of executing and analysing apk files statically and dynamically.
